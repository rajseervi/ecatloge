## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur

#### Minor Issues (Visual glitches, minor bugs)
**Action**: Fix forward
1. Identify the issue
2. Create hotfix
3. Test locally
4. Deploy fix

#### Major Issues (Crashes, data errors)
**Action**: Rollback
1. Revert to previous commit
2. Redeploy previous version
3. Investigate issue offline
4. Fix and redeploy when ready

### Rollback Commands
```bash
# Git rollback
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or restore previous commit
git reset --hard <previous-commit-hash>
git push --force origin main
```

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Static Colors**: 8 colors cycle for categories (9+ categories reuse colors)
2. **Chart Limits**: Donut legend shows 6 categories, bar chart shows 8
3. **No Drill-down**: Can't click chart to filter products (future enhancement)
4. **No Export**: Can't export charts as images (future enhancement)
5. **No Time Range**: Shows current data only (future enhancement)

### Workarounds
1. **Color Cycling**: Acceptable for most use cases, rarely have 9+ categories
2. **Chart Limits**: Full data available in table below
3. **Drill-down**: Users can use existing filters
4. **Export**: Users can screenshot
5. **Time Range**: Current data is most relevant

## Support Information

### For Administrators
**How to use the dashboard**:
1. Navigate to `/admin`
2. View stats cards at top
3. Analyze donut chart for distribution
4. Compare categories in bar chart
5. Review detailed metrics in table

**Understanding the data**:
- **Donut Chart**: Shows what percentage of products are in each category
- **Bar Chart**: Shows how many products are in each category
- **Table**: Shows detailed metrics for each category

### For Developers
**Code location**: `src/app/admin/page.tsx`

**Key functions**:
- `calculateStats()`: Calculates all statistics and category analysis
- `CategoryAnalysis` interface: Defines category data structure

**Customization**:
- Colors: Edit `colors` array in `calculateStats()`
- Chart sizes: Modify SVG dimensions and radius values
- Display limits: Change `.slice(0, n)` values

### For Support Team
**Common questions**:

Q: Why don't I see the Total Products card?
A: It's now displayed in the center of the donut chart.

Q: What do the colors mean?
A: Each category is assigned a unique color for easy identification across all visualizations.

Q: Why are some categories missing from the donut legend?
A: The legend shows the top 6 categories. All categories are visible in the table below.

Q: Can I export the charts?
A: Not currently, but you can take screenshots. Export feature is planned for future.
