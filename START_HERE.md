# 🚀 START HERE - Quick Fix Guide

## ✅ The Configuration Error Has Been Fixed!

The `/?error=Configuration` error was caused by missing environment variables. This has now been resolved.

## 🎯 What You Need to Do (3 Simple Steps)

### ⚡ Step 1: RESTART Your Dev Server
**This is the most important step!**

```bash
# In your terminal where the dev server is running:
# 1. Press: Ctrl + C (to stop the server)
# 2. Then run:
npm run dev
```

**Why?** Environment variables only load when the server starts. Without restarting, the fix won't take effect.

### 👤 Step 2: Create Your First Admin User

   ```
   http://localhost:3003/setup-admin
   ```

2. Fill in the form:
   - **Email:** `admin@example.com` (or any email you want)
   - **Password:** `Admin123!` (or any password - minimum 6 characters)

3. Click **"Create Admin User"**

4. Wait for the success message ✅

### 🔐 Step 3: Test the Login

   ```
   http://localhost:3003/admin
   ```

2. You should see: **"Authentication Required"** page (not an error!)
