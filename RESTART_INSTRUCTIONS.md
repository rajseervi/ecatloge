# 🔄 RESTART REQUIRED

## The Configuration Error is Fixed!

The `/?error=Configuration` error was caused by missing environment variables.

### What Was Fixed:
✅ Added `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to `.env.local`
✅ Added `NEXTAUTH_URL` to `.env.local`
✅ Updated NextAuth configuration to use the secret

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: You MUST Restart Your Dev Server

Environment variables are only loaded when the Next.js server starts.

### Steps to Restart:

1. **Stop the current dev server:**
   - Press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal

2. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Wait for it to compile:**
   - You should see: `✓ Ready in X seconds`

4. **Test the authentication:**
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:3003/admin`
   - You should now see the "Authentication Required" page instead of the error

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist:

After restarting, test these scenarios:

### ✅ Test 1: Access Protected Route (Unauthenticated)
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:3003/admin`
- **Expected:** See "Authentication Required" page with "Sign In" button
- **Not:** `/?error=Configuration` error

### ✅ Test 2: Create Admin User
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:3003/setup-admin`
- Fill in the form:
  - Email: `admin@example.com`
  - Password: `Admin123!` (or your choice)
- Click "Create Admin User"
- **Expected:** Success message

### ✅ Test 3: Login
- Go back to: `http://localhost:3003/admin`
- Click "Sign In" button
- Enter your credentials
- **Expected:** Login modal appears, then you're logged in and see the admin dashboard

### ✅ Test 4: Logout
- Click "Log out" button in the header
- **Expected:** Redirected to home page
- Try accessing `/admin` again - should require login

## 🔐 Environment Variables Added:

```env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production-min-32-chars
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3003
```

### For Production:
When deploying to production, make sure to:
1. Generate a secure random secret:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
2. Set `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to that value
3. Set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to your production domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)

## 🐛 If You Still See Errors:

1. **Make sure the server restarted:**
   - Check terminal for "✓ Ready" message
   
2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)
   
3. **Check the terminal for errors:**
   - Look for any red error messages
   
4. **Verify .env.local file:**
   - Make sure it's in the root directory
   - Make sure there are no typos

---

## 📝 What Changed:

**File: `.env.local`**
- Added NextAuth configuration variables

**File: `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`**
- Removed fallback secret (now requires environment variable)

## ✨ After Restart, Everything Should Work!

The authentication system is fully configured and ready to use.
